## About me

I'm a web developer, mostly) In this field for more than 3 years.For the first time, my path in this business began in the 10th grade, when my dad bought me a laptop for studying. Then the coronavirus had just begun. I studied a lot of things: Python, JavaScript, C++, Arduino Wiring. But my soul is still closer to Web and JavaScript. Although I respect his ECMAScript specification more.

+ I'm based in Russia, Krasnodar
+ You can contact me at **ShahTheShah@ya.ru**
+ I have a very strong desire to develop in my field until the moment when they will already run after me)
